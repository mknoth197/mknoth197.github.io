title: "Global Gateway – External API Platform"
summary: "At John Deere Financial, I helped turn an early API-gateway effort into a safer path for dealer software by architecting the platform's first external-facing API with role-based authorization and audit logging. That foundation later matured into the JDF API Gateway used for both internal and external APIs."

## Scope

This was an early attempt to create at John Deere Financial what a product such as Azure API Management provides: a common platform for governing and exposing APIs to internal consumers and dealer software. My part focused on safely exposing a selected business capability *outside* the company—opening dealer access to sales-lead data without treating security and observability as afterthoughts.

## What I built

- The platform's **inaugural external API**, architected with **role-based authorization** and **audit logging** from day one.

## Outcome

The work established a reusable pattern for exposing business-critical data to external partners, with security and auditability designed in rather than bolted on. The early platform later matured into the JDF API Gateway used to host APIs for both internal and external consumers.
